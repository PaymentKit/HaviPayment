 @WARNING: This delegate will extract the date from the service response (NSHTTPURLResponse), more precisely,
 from the 'Date' field in the HTTP Header response, therefore if this date is not the 'Date we stored the 
 cached response' then you would probably have unexpected behavior. Of course, as a client you could choose
 your own strategy to handle this.
